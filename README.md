# spam-sms-classifier
This project is a simple SMS Spam Detection System built using Python, Scikit-Learn, and TF-IDF text vectorization. It classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using a Naive Bayes classifier, which is one of the most effective algorithms for text classification.

# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier (Machine Learning Project)

This project classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using:

- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- 80/20 Train–Test split  
- Precision / Recall / F1-score evaluation  

The script also includes a **real-time message classifier** where you can input your own texts.
